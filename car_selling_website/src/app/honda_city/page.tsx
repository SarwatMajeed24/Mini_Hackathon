            <br />
             <p className="text-xs leading-7">
             The Honda City 2024 is a subcompact sedan that has been manufactured by the Japanese automobile manufacturer Honda since 1981. Initially, it was a 3-door hatchback/2-door convertible launched only in selected markets. The second-generation Honda City was launched in 1986, but the City nameplate was discontinued in 1994 and replaced by another model.The Honda City was reintroduced in 1996 as a series of subcompact four-door sedans. This third-generation City was built on Honda Global Small Car platform in which the location of the fuel tank is under the front seats rather than rear seats. The third generation of Honda City gained its name among the consumers as it hit back the sales of Suzuki Margalla in its early days. The company also introduced a facelift version of the third-gen Honda City in 2000 and continued its production for another three years before introducing the next generation in Pakistan.The fourth-generation Honda City was launched globally in 2002 and later received a facelift in 2005. Honda City was reintroduced in the Pakistani market when Honda introduced the fourth generation of the popular compact sedan in 2003. The level of fuel economy was brought to another level with the introduction of the twin-spark i-DSI engine-based City. It became immensely popular in the local market and is still considered as one of the most fuel-efficient cars in its league. Owing to its popularity, the company also launched a facelift version in 2005 which continued till 2008. Some major changes were made in the exterior of the car while slight changes in the interior were also observed. It is worth mentioning here that the steermatic version of the third generation did not go too well in the local auto market.The fifth generation of Honda City Pakistan was launched back in 2009, and since then, we have seen many facelift versions of the car. The company is yet to give up on this particular model, and it has passed a decade of production. The popularity of Honda’s compact sedan still prevails owing to its fuel economy and smooth drive, although there are still no airbags at any trim level. It is available in 1.3L and 1.5L variants in the country. Since 2009, it has received plenty of cosmetic changes, including the new design of the front radiator grille, headlights, and tail lights.The sixth generation City debuted in the international market in 2014 and was replaced by the next seventh generation last year, in 2020, but arrived in Pakistan in 2021.

The engine performance is efficient with minimal turbo lag, however, it may start to shiver above 4000rpm. One major drawback is the lack of vehicle stability control which puts it at a disadvantage compared to its competitors.
